Lukas Schwab mothership, build by Lukas Schwab using [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com).

## Thanks

+ The [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) team.
+ [Colby Aley](http://www.colbyaley.com); I used a bit of javascript originally written by him.
+ [Kathryn Liu](https://www.facebook.com/kathrynksliu); she took a photo of me that isn't really flattering but is still dear to me, and which features on the landing page. Baller photographer.

## To-do

+ Custom domain?
+ New icon?
+ Click on profile picture for index.html (done)
    + Requres hover to show link? http://geekgirllife.com/place-text-over-images-on-hover-without-javascript/
    + This is now an antiquated method ("index.html" links at the top of every page). Kept in the To-do section as a bit of a backburner project.
+ Want to unveil multiple hidden bits with different links
+ Make images for each page -- just About left
